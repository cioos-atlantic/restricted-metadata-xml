This is a simple tool to help add restricted keyword infomration to an xml file.

To setup, specify the file to run on in the appender_config.ini under 'input_file'

In the config, also specify the restricted keywords to add (English and French). 
Restricted EOVs can be included with the restricted keywords field.
To ensure that CKAN recognizes it as an EOV, add the term in lowercase without any spaces (Sea State becomes seastate)
